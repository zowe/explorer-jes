1. Install Node with NPM
2. Run `npm install`
3. Install Mozilla Firefox
4. Access to a Zowe install running on z/OS

### Run Tests:

Parameter values should be replaced with your own.  
Either create environment variables listed below
or create a .env file in the root directory during develpment
