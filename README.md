## Build 

### Install Dependencies

Configure your npm registry to pickup Zowe dependencies
```
npm config set registry https://zowe.jfrog.io/zowe/api/npm/npm-release/
npm install
```

### Build for Development

Modify the host variable in WebContent/js/utilities/urlUtils.js to a host and port that has the Zowe Jobs API server available

```
npm run dev 
```

Then you can visit http://localhost:8080 to test.
When testing you may see errors with API calls do to CORS (Cross origin resource sharing), to work around this you may disable CORS checking in your browser for local development. 


### Build for Production

```
npm run prod
```

### Prepare for commit (Run linting, tests and production build)
```
npm run preCommit
```

### Prepare PAX Packaging Workspace

```
./scripts/prepare-workspace.sh
```

## Start With explorer-ui-server

After preparing PAX workspace, you can serve the explorer UI with explorer-ui-server:

```
node .pax/ascii/server/src/index.js --config .pax/ascii/server/configs/config.json
```

## Run SonarQube Code Analysis

Install [SonarQube Scanner](https://docs.sonarqube.org/display/SCAN/Analyzing+with+SonarQube+Scanner).

If you are using Mac, try install with [HomeBrew sonar-scanner formula](https://formulae.brew.sh/formula/sonar-scanner), then update the configuration of SonarQube server at `/usr/local/Cellar/sonar-scanner/<version>/libexec/conf/sonar-scanner.properties`.

Example scanner configurations:

```
sonar.host.url=https://jayne.zowe.org:9000
sonar.login=<hash>
```

Then you can run `sonar-scanner` to start code analysis.

Build pipeline has embedded the SonarQube code analysis stage.
